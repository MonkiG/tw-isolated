# tw-isolated

> Tailwind CSS isolated inside Shadow DOM using Web Components.

`tw-isolated` is a lightweight custom element that encapsulates **Tailwind CSS** (CDN-based for now) inside a **Shadow DOM**, preventing external styles from affecting Tailwind and vice versa.

This project is designed for **legacy environments**, **mixed CSS stacks**, and **incremental migrations**, where global CSS conflicts make Tailwind hard to use safely.
